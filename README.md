# next-boi

The goal of this project is to make my own personal Blog using typescript, react. and Next.js

All posts are going to be written in raw react, no markdown compilers will be used. I am going to do this like you would if you were learning it from scratch, which I am. I have little previus knowledge of react or javascript, but know html and css relatively well, this repository does not show best practices, mainly because I don't know what those are.
